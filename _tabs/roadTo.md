## Objective

"Road to Devops" is a project I started recently, as I wanted to learn more about Devops and SRE technologies. Each article is inspired by [this excellent roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/devops), and will try to cover and test my knowledge on each subject before I can dive more into IaC. 

I will try to focus on the inner architecture and useful commands, without diving too much into the details. If you see any inconsistencies or missing items, you are more than welcome to tell me. What I will find interesting next is to use each article as basis for further project ideas.
