## Objective

While writing *bin-sh*, I often need to test commands in recent systems, see if everything is still working as It is supposed to, or If there was any upgrades. 

The main project, called **bin-sh**, standing for the usual first header of a bash script, is to build an entire infrastructure, with whatever fancy tool of the moment (cloud, kubernetes, bare-metal, containers, etc.). But while working on this, I sometimes have some random ideas about QoL improvements I can have (like a dotfile that I can replicate among all my systems). This part is used to record those projects and in what state they currently are (mostly WIP).
