## Objective

While writing *roadTo*, I often need to test commands in recent systems, see if everything is still working as It is supposed to, or If there was any upgrades. 

The main project, called **Bob**, is to build an entire devops infrastructure, with docker, cloud, k8s, ansible, terraform, cloud providers and else. But while working on this, I sometimes have some random ideas about QoL improvements I can have (like a zsh theme that I can replicate among all my systems). This part is used to record those projects and in what state they currently are (mostly WIP).
