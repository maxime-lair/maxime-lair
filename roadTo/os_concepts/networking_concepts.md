# Networking concepts

In this article, we will try to focus on the layer 2 and 3 of the OSI model.

We will try to understand IP v4/v6 works without diving too much into details, and understand how It is routed across networks.

We could also call it understanding the network layer, as we will cover *ARP/ICMP/MAC/LLC*

## Datalink layer

Organize bits into frames and provides hop-to-hop delivery

### Ethernet 802.xx

### MAC/LLC

### Switch/Bridge/WAP

## Network layer

Organize frames into packets (fragmentation + reassembly), and decide on path from source to destination

### IPv4

### IPv6

### ARP

### ICMP

## Useful commands and utilities

### IP command

### /proc

### /sys
