## Project start

This page will be used to record the installation of a self-hosted devops environment.

The end-goal is to have an infrastructure running several services:
- Prometheus & Grafana for monitoring purpose
- Node_exporter (for host metrics) and Cadvisor (for docker metrics) on each host
- Traefik to handle routing and load-balancing
- Web application powered by httpd

All these applications will be running inside dockers, as to be scalable in the future

It will start as a single host project and will slowly be turning into multiple-hosts

## First installation

# Docker

We need to install docker on each host, It has to be done through a sudo or root user as the final process will be running with root privileges (constraint of docker).

We follow the [instructions as per recommended](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/centos/) to guide us through

We start off with the first docker installation
