### Journey into doing devops, sre and platform stuffðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working for a market maker in (crypto) finance, mainly working on a Rust-based Kubernetes deployment platform.
- ðŸŒ± I used to follow this [roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/devops)

- ðŸ“« Shoot me a comment in any of my projects, I'm always eager to improve
- âš¡ About me: graduated in IT security, worked in electronic market in finance, then in video broadcasting, and now in crypto market making

A lot is left for me to learn, and I'm using this place to help me write it all. I'm not expecting any readers, I'm mainly doing this because I learn better when writing my findings.

Here is a list of some envisionned projects:
- Using docker compose to create a good local development environment
- Creating a production-grade template rust repository for kickstarting new projects
- Using ansible to configure some bare-metal hosts
- Continuous deployment with FluxCD or ArgoCD
- Having fun with [kubernetes]([https://roadmap.sh/devops](https://blog.palark.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/kubernetes-iceberg.png))

And many others projects

I used to write articles a few years ago on this [github pages](https://maxime-lair.github.io/maxime-lair/), I might start again :)
