### Journey into learning devops ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on implementing an IaC
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently following this [roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/devops)

- ðŸ“« Shoot me a comment in any of my projects, I'm always eager to improve
- âš¡ About me: graduated in IT security, worked in ops

A lot is left for me to learn, and I'm using this place to help me write it all. I'm not expecting any readers, I'm mainly doing this because I learn better when writing my findings.

Here is a list of some envisionned projects:
- Docker compose/swarm on a single host
- Scale it up on multiple hosts with kubernetes
- Deploy them with ansible/chef/puppet to ease up host configuration
- Add Contineous Integration tool with jenkins/Tekton pipelines
- Add Contineous Deployment tool with Spinnaker/GoCD/ScrewDriver
- Think of using Terraform at one point

And many others projects
