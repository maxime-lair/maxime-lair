### Journey into learning devops ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building docker swarm infrastructure with web hosting and monitoring
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning docker and prometheus

- ðŸ“« Shoot me a comment in any of my projects, I'm always eager to improve
- âš¡ Fun fact: graduated in IT security, worked in production environment

A lot is left for me to learn, and I'm using this place to help me write it all. I'm not expecting anyone to read me, I'm mainly doing this because I learn better when writing my findings.

Here is a list of some envisionned projects:
- Docker compose/swarm on a single host
- Scale it up on multiple hosts with kubernetes
- Deploy them with ansible/chef/puppet to ease up host configuration
- Add Contineous Integration tool with jenkins/Tekton pipelines
- Add Contineous Deployment tool with Spinnaker/GoCD/ScrewDriver
- Think of using Terraform at one point

And many others projects
